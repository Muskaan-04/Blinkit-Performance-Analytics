This project presents a comprehensive end-to-end sales analysis of Blinkit's retail data using **Python**, **Power BI**, and a structured **CSV dataset**. It replicates a real-world business intelligence solution â€” from raw data preprocessing and SQL-based queries to dashboard visualization and insight generation.
